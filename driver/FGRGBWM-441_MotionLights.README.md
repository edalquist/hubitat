# Fibaro RGBW Controller (FGRGBWM-441) - Light & Motion

This is a special variant driver for a FGRGBWM-441 that uses three of inputs to provide for an up/down momentary
switch and a motion sensor to control the fourth output as a dimmer.

## Controller Board

See https://easyeda.com/eric.dalquist/MotionDimmer for the PCB the FGRGBWM-441 is wired to. The board mostly makes it
easier to manage wiring the various components together.
